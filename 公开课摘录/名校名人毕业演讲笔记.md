## 丹泽尔·华盛顿-宾夕法尼亚大学2011毕业典礼演讲

> 丹泽尔·华盛顿是好莱坞最具号召力的演员之一，也是目前好莱坞身价最高的黑人影星。
> 演艺生涯初期在电视剧中发展，80年代后转入电影业，90年代终被好莱坞所接纳，跨入A级演员的行列。
> 1990年凭借电影《光荣》获第62届奥斯卡最佳男配角奖，2000年凭借电影《飓风》获得第57届金球奖最佳男主角(剧情类) ，2002年凭借电影《训练日》获第74届奥斯卡最佳男主角奖，是继西德尼·波蒂埃后第二位黑人影帝。在好莱坞的黑人影星中，也只有威尔·史密斯能与他分庭抗礼。曾有人评论他说：他不是一个伟大的黑人，而是一个有着黑色皮肤的伟大的人。





1、 Even thogh I was afraid I might make a fool of myself, In fact, if you really want to know the truth. I had to come exactly because I might make a fool of myself。

尽管我害怕自己会出洋相，其实，如果你们真的想知道真相,正是因为我有可能出洋相所以我才一定要来。



2、I‘ve found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks,nothing.

我发如果你不冒险，生活中的一切都会是毫无价值，无一例外。



3、There is no passion to be found playing small in settling for a life that's less than the one you're capable of living.

如果安于现状，生活将平淡无奇，尤其对于那些有能力去过更精彩人生的人来说



4、Now I'm sure in your experiences , in school, in applying to college in picking your major in deciding what you want to do with life, I'm sure people have told you to make sure you have something to fall back on. But I've never understood that concept. Having something to fall back on, If I'm going to fall , I don't want to fall back on anything, except my faith.I want to fall forward, I figure at least this way, I'll see what I'm about to hit.

我肯定在你们过去的经历中，无论是在学校，在申报大学，在挑选专业还是你们在决定人生中要做些什么时，总会有人提醒你们要记着给自己留条后路。但我对此表示无法理解。要留后路，如果我会跌倒失败，我不想留什么后路，除了自己的信念。我要向前倒。这样，至少我能看见，我会栽在什么问题上。



5、Every failed experiment is one step closer to success, You've got to take risks.And I'm sure you've probably heard that before. I've got three reasons, and then you can pick up your IPhones. First, you will fail at some point in your life, Accept it. You will lose, You will embarrass yourself,You will suck at something. There is no doubt about it.

每次失败都意味着你离成功靠近了一步，你必须去冒险。我想你们以前一定也听过这些。我要说三个理由，然后你们就可以玩Iphone了。首先，你在生命中一定会经历失败，接受这个事实吧，失败是无可避免的，你会感到窘迫，你会在某件事上逊透了，这点毫无疑问。



6、The point is, every graduate here today, has the training and the talent to succeed,But do you have guts to fail?

今天在座的所有毕业生，你们都有了成功所必需的锻炼和才能，然而你们有接受失败的勇气吗？



7、Here's my second point about failure, If you don't fail, you're not even trying. My wife told me this expression , To get something you never had you have to do something you never did.

关于失败，我要说的第二个要点是，如果你没有失败过，说明你都没有好好尝试过。我太太跟我说过这句经典的话，要得到你从未拥有过的东西，你必须做你从来没有做过的事。





8、Les Brown, a motivational speaker, he made an analogy about this. Imagine you're on your deathbed , and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfilled potential, The ghosts of the ideas you never acted on. The ghosts of the talents you didn't use, And they're standing around your bed, Angry, Disappointed, Upset. So you gotta get out there , Whether It's your time, your talent, your prayers, or yur treasures.You'll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse, You can't take it with you.

励志演讲者莱斯·布朗对此打过一个比方，想象你快要去世了，围绕着在你临终的床沿的，是代表你未了心愿的幽魂，那些你没有付诸行动的想法的幽魂，那些属于你却从来没被启用的天赋的幽魂，而它们都围绕在你的床沿，生气、失望、沮丧。出去闯吧，你要投入自己的一切，不论是你的时间还是才华，祈福还是财富。灵车后面不会有搬家卡车,你不可能把他们一起带走。



9、So, the question is, what are you going to do with what you have? I'm not talking how much you have, Some of you are business majors, Some of you are theologians, nurses, sociologists, Some of you have money. Some of you have patience,Some have kindness, some have love, Some of you have the gift of long-suffering. Whatever it is, whatever your gift is? What are you going to do with what you have?

所以问题在于，你要怎么利用你拥有的东西？我不是在说你拥有多少，在座的诸位，有人学商科，有人会成为神学家、护士或是社会学家。有些人有钱，有些人有耐心，有些人有善心，有些人心中充满爱,有些人拥有历经艰苦而带来的果实，不论你拥有的是什么，你的天赋是什么？你打算怎么利用它们呢？



10、Sometimes it's the best way to figure out where you're going, Your life will never be a straight path. I took a course called Cardiac... Morph...  I still can't say it,Cardiac Morphogenesis, I couldn't read it I could't say it, and I an sure couldn't pass it. So, then Idecided to go pre-law, then journalism,And with no academic focus. My grades took off in their own direction, Yeah, down. I was a 1.8 GPA, one semester

有时候失败是找到方向的最好方法，生活不会是一条直线。我学过一门课程叫心...形... 我连这个都说不好,心脏心态学。后来我就决定读法律预科，再后来是新闻学，不知道应该专注于什么学科，我的成绩进入了它自己的轨道。没错，一路向下。有一个学期，我的平均分只有1.8。



11、You'll see everything I'm talking about today, You'll see what I mean about taking risks, or being willing to fail. Because taking a risk is not just about going for a job, It's also about knowing what you know and what you don't know. It's about being open to people and to ideas.In the course of the film, the character I play begins to take small steps, small risks,He very very very slowly began to overcome his fears, and I felt ultimately his heart becomes flooded with love. To not only take risks, but to be open to life, To accept new views and to be open new opinions. Because the chances you take, the people you meet, the people you love, the faith that you have, that's what's going to define you.

你就会明白我今天所说的一切，你会看到我所说的冒险精神，或者说是敢于失败，因为去冒险不仅是为了谋生，它更是能帮助你发现什么是你知道的，什么是你不知道的。它意味着去接受任何人和任何想法。在影片中，我扮演的角色开始慢慢尝试冒险,他很慢很慢地开始克服自己的恐惧，最终他的内心会洋溢着爱。不仅要愿意冒险，还要对生活敞开胸怀，接受新的看法、新的观点。因为你冒的险，你遇到的人，你所爱之人，你拥有的信念，是这些会书写你的人生。
